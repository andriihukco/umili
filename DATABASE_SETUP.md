# Database Setup Instructions

## Fresh Database Implementation

This project has been updated with a new database schema that implements a clean user-client chat system with application functionality.

## Database Schema Changes

### Key Changes:

1. **Simplified Schema**: Removed complex relationships and focused on core functionality
2. **New Tables**:
   - `conversations`: Links clients and freelancers for specific tasks
   - `messages`: Chat messages within conversations
   - Updated `tasks` table with `client_id` and `freelancer_id`
   - Updated `applications` table for apply/reject functionality

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Run the SQL Schema**:

   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of supabase-schema.sql into your Supabase SQL Editor
   -- This will drop existing tables and create the new schema
   ```

2. **Key Features Implemented**:

   - **Chat System**: Conversations are automatically created when applications are accepted
   - **Application System**: Freelancers can apply to tasks, clients can accept/reject
   - **Real-time Updates**: Messages and applications update in real-time
   - **Role-based Access**: Proper permissions for clients and freelancers

3. **Workflow**:
   - Clients create tasks
   - Freelancers apply to tasks with messages and proposed budgets
   - Clients can accept/reject applications
   - When accepted, a conversation is automatically created
   - Chat becomes available for project discussion

## Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Register as a Client**: Create tasks
